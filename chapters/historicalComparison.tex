\Chapter{Homology and stratum}{Historical language comparison}
\label{ch:history}

historical process leading to similarity

homology: historically related form
calque: historically related meaning (important for creoles, and large-areal consistencies!!!)
stratum: point of transfer

note: `all words that start with [p]' (ringe 1992) is strictly speaking a typological characteristic! It is not a historical comparison, because it does not take into account sound change.

homology, recent stratum: loan
homology, old stratum: cognate
calque: always loan?
