macro:->There
is
a
growing
awareness
that
linguistics
can
also
profitably
be
directly
based
on
individual
utterances,
or
\textsc
{exemplars}.
Such
a
token-based
approach
is
obviously
taken
in
research
using
corpora.
In
the
context
of
language
change,
see
the
\textsc
{theory
of
utterance
selection}
(Croft
2000)

this

macro:->Beside
the
term
\textsc
{domain}
there
are
many
other
terms
encountered
in
the
literature
with
basically
the
same
gist,
e.g
\textsc
{tertium
comparationis},
\textsc
{comparative
concept}
(Haspelmath
2010),
\textsc
{etic
grid}
(Levinson
\&
Meira
2003),
\textsc
{analytical
primitive}
(Cysouw
2010),
\textsc
{sense/function}
(Haspelmath
2003).

macro:->Feyerabend's
(1975)
dictum
`anything
goes'
is
often
misunderstood
as
suggesting
that
every
method
is
equally
suitable.
Haspelmath's
(2010)
term
`categorical
particularism'
seems
to
be
misunderstood
in
the
same
way.
The
only,
rather
trivial,
point
made
by
both
is
that
there
should
be
no
`Denkverbote',
i.e.
you
are
allowed
to
`think
out
of
the
box'
if
you
find
that
that
is
useful.
The
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating.
